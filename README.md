# WikiViz
Takes a user-inputted Wikipedia article and generates a map of all the related articles. Created 2021 by George King and Andrew Nakamoto.

To use the program, download all the files and run WikiPageGraph. Ensure all the JARs are in the same folder, and you may need to set up classpaths depending on the IDE. Demo video available at https://youtu.be/cmZ5-wvgRYY.
